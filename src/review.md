# Datapack Review

This section contains information about how to properly verify a datapack inside `#📍request-review` channel.

## Tooling

Although this step is not required, this tooling is recommended by me for its convenience with verifying datapack.

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/)
2. Install the following extensions.
    1. [Datapack Helper Plus (MCF)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SPGoding.datapack-language-server)
        - This extension provides a syntax highlighting and various helper functionality to navigate through datapack.
    2. [Datapack Helper Plus (JSON)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SPGoding.datapack-json)
        - This extension provide similar functionality to `MCF` but for JSON files.
    3. [tellraw preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=actuallyboomber.tellraw-preview)
        - This extension provides text preview for commands that display a message to the player.

## Verifying a Datapack

A datapack **must** follow all of **Tier 3** conventions to be verified, any datapack that does not follow **Tier 2** conventions will be notified as a warning.

Every verification must report back to the creator, This can be done in any way as you wish. Such as via private messaging or `#📍request-review` channel.

When the datapack is verified, you can post it to `#✅certified-datapacks` channel in the following format:
```
<Datapack name> by <Creator name>
<url to the project page>
```
It can also be changed if you see fit. You also need to notify them that they can use the convention banner on their project page.

> As of right now, I only made a page for Tier 3 conventions. The lower tier will be made later.
